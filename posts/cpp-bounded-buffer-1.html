            <p>As part of an autonomous drone project I’m working on, I created a program which
displays the drone’s position and orientation in real-time. This program
required a mechanism to manage the flow of data coming from a telemetry
receiver.</p>

<p>To address this, I implemented a thread-safe bounded buffer in C++ with multiple
interfaces to satisfy different use-cases. The data structure is fully tested
with <a href="https://github.com/google/googletest">GoogleTest</a> and is available <a href="https://github.com/jdtaylor7/bounded_buffer">on
Github</a> as a header-only library.</p>

<p>This post discusses the background and motivation of bounded buffers, along with
some of the requirements for an implementation and necessary multithreading
concepts. The next post, part 2, will dive into the buffer’s interface and
implementation.</p>

<h2 id="producerconsumer-pattern">Producer/Consumer Pattern</h2>

<p>Before discussing the bounded buffer itself, let me first explain the main
scenario in which bounded buffers can be useful. The producer/consumer pattern
is a general software pattern which describes the interaction between two
parties, a producer and a consumer.</p>

<p>Consider the following real-world scenario: A donut shop (the producer)
generates donuts continuously while customers (the consumers) purchase donuts
throughout the day. The donut shop uses traffic from previous days to predict
how many donuts are needed at different times of the day. That being said, the
customers themselves are still fundamentally unpredictable and as a whole they
do not purchase donuts at some strict rate. The shop uses racks to store the
donuts, which are being emptied and replenished continuously.</p>

<p>In this example, we have the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resource: Donuts</li>
  <li>Producer: Donut shop</li>
  <li>Consumer: Customers</li>
  <li>Storage mechanism: Donut racks</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a producer/consumer situation. Resources are generated and used by
various parties, while some mechanism holds the resources  awaiting consumption.
Resources can be produced/consumed at fixed rates, intermittently, or both.
Multiple producers and/or consumers may be present.</p>

<p>The producer/consumer problem arises in multiple areas of software. Some
examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An operating system sending and receiving packets through network interfaces</li>
  <li>A hardware device passing received data to a software application for
processing, such as a thermostat passing temperature data to a home automation
system</li>
  <li>A game server receiving data from multiple clients and updating the game
environment accordingly</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bounded-buffers">Bounded Buffers</h2>

<p>In the above donut shop scenario, the donut racks serve as a literal buffer
between the donut-making machines and the customers. They also happen to be
bounded by their size, which determines how many donuts they can hold. They
allow for discrepancies between the production and consumption rates inherently
present in the system. In the same way, bounded buffers are used to solve the
general problem related to mismatched production/consumption rates among
multiple parties.</p>

<p>In practice, a bounded buffer is just a queue with specific input/output
properties. Let’s look at a graphical representation of a bounded buffer:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/bounded-buffer@2x-83e4c0f82b6eeb75bfe2b91797425c781c20ba5b30a297f9dfa29a386af1e07f.png">
  <img src="/assets/bounded-buffer-f74ea817f74fd6ff30c40b108dfe9761c67bbb86b7dd28a834ca9aec1668b424.png" alt="Bounded buffer graphic" class="zooming" data-rjs="/assets/bounded-buffer@2x-83e4c0f82b6eeb75bfe2b91797425c781c20ba5b30a297f9dfa29a386af1e07f.png" data-zooming-width="1114" data-zooming-height="355" />
</a></p>

<p>First, the buffer has a <strong>capacity</strong> which defines the maximum number of
elements that can be stored. This is why the buffer is called bounded. The
<strong>size</strong> of the buffer, in keeping with the terminology of C++’s standard
containers, is the current number of elements in the buffer.</p>

<p>Since the buffer is a queue, elements are removed in the same order that they
were placed into it: first in, first out (FIFO). Multiple producers and multiple
consumers are permitted. Producers may only insert elements into the buffer,
while consumers may only remove elements from it.</p>

<h4 id="bounded-buffer-inputoutput">Bounded Buffer Input/Output</h4>

<p>Bounded buffers have a few complications, the first of which is controlling
producer/consumer access to the data. When a buffer is just partially full, this
is straightforward because data can be inserted or removed without issue. The
problem arises when attempting to add data to a full buffer or remove data from
an empty buffer.</p>

<p>Remembering the donut shop example, what should be done when more donuts are
made than can be held in the storage racks? Conversely, what should a customer
do when no donuts are available in the storage racks? To answer the first
problem, the theoretical solutions are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Discard the extra donuts</li>
  <li>Pause the donut assembly line indefinitely until space is available</li>
  <li>Wait some finite amount of time for space to become available, but start
throwing donuts out when that time passes</li>
  <li>Discard the oldest donuts from the racks to make space for the newer donuts</li>
</ol>

<p>In real life, these approaches may not be sufficient. In an actual donut shop,
additional solutions would likely be employed. More storage would be used, donut
production would be slowed, and donut production would likely be slowed under in
the future to prevent the problem from occurring again. These additional
measures may or may not be under one’s control in a software system, but
regardless they are separate from the bounded buffer itself. Thus, we will stick
to these four solutions.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at a customer’s options when no donuts are ready:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Leave the donut shop</li>
  <li>Wait indefinitely for donuts to become available</li>
  <li>Wait a finite amount of time for donuts to be ready, leave once this time
passes</li>
</ol>

<p>These options correspond to the first three producer’s options, since the fourth
is not possible from the consumer’s perspective.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s map these donut shop options to those for a bounded buffer:</p>

<p>Producer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do not add the element and mark the operation as failed</li>
  <li>Wait until there is space to add the element</li>
  <li>Wait some set amount of time for space to be created, fail if the time
expires</li>
  <li>Create space by removing an element, then add the element</li>
</ol>

<p>Consumer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do not remove any elements and mark the operation as failed</li>
  <li>Wait until an element is present</li>
  <li>Wait a set amount of time for an element to be available, fail if the time
expires</li>
</ol>

<p>These options are all implemented in the bounded buffer I created. This will be
discussed more in part 2.</p>

<h4 id="race-conditions">Race Conditions</h4>

<p>Another complication regarding bounded buffers is that of <strong>race conditions</strong>. A
race condition occurs when multiple threads “race” to access a resource at the
same time. If two threads are attempting to execute a function at the same time,
it’s possible that one function will start executing while the other is already
running. This can lead to incorrect results if not disallowed. Take the
following function (interpret it, and the remaining code in this section, as
pseudocode):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">global_val</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">increment_global</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">tmp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">global_val</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">tmp</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tmp</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If two threads were to execute the function at the same time, the results should
look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">tmpA</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// thread A</span>
<span class="n">tmpA</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>                 <span class="c1">// thread A</span>
<span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tmpA</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>      <span class="c1">// thread A</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">tmpB</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// thread B</span>
<span class="n">tmpB</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span>                 <span class="c1">// thread B</span>
<span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tmpB</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span>      <span class="c1">// thread B --&gt; correct value!</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Either thread A or B could be executed first, but the main point is that one
thread should run to completion before the next starts executing. But as it
stands, the results could look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">tmpA</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// thread A</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">tmpB</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// thread B</span>
<span class="n">tmpA</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// thread A</span>
<span class="n">tmpB</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// thread B</span>
<span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tmpA</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// thread A</span>
<span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tmpB</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// thread B --&gt; wrong value!</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Instead of thread A running to completion before thread B starts, the code of
the two functions could become interleaved. This would cause thread B to use the
wrong initial value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">global_val</code> (1) instead of the intended value (2). To
be clear, the issue is not quite that two of the <em>same</em> function are being run
in parallel - the problem could arise if the two threads were running different
functions. The real problem is that both threads access the same <strong>shared data</strong>
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">global_val</code>) without any restrictions. Some kind of <strong>access control</strong> must be
provided for the shared data. This is achieved with a <strong>lock</strong>, also called a
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex"><strong>mutex</strong></a> (short for mutual
exclusion).</p>

<p>A mutex can be compared to the lock on a porta potty. When approaching the
stall, you first check the condition of the lock. If the lock is red, it means
that someone is already using the toilet and you must wait. If the lock is
green, the stall is unoccupied and access can be obtained. Claiming a porta
potty for oneself requires more than just walking in and closing the door,
though. Upon entering the bathroom you must lock the stall, setting it to the
occupied state so others know not to enter. Mutexes are similar in the sense
that they are technically optional and may not always end up being required (for
example, maybe no one tried to enter the bathroom while you were using it). Not
using them, however, can result in some unfortunate situations.</p>

<p>There is some additional terminology concerning mutexes. They are said to be
<strong>acquired</strong> and <strong>released</strong> when a thread obtains them or gives them up
(locking and unlocking the bathroom stall, accordingly). Their operation is also
said to be <strong>atomic</strong>, which means that no instructions from other threads can
interrupt their operations. Operations including “normal” data types like
regular Booleans are not atomic and thus cannot guarantee the prevention of race
conditions like mutexes can (read more about this
<a href="https://preshing.com/20130618/atomic-vs-non-atomic-operations/">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/tbb_userguide/Atomic_Operations.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>If we require that a lock be obtained before acting on a shared resource, then
every instruction is safe while the lock is held. This enforces the following
scenario, consistently (more pseudocode):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">global_val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">mutex</span> <span class="n">global_val_mtx</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">// both threads attempt to acquire the lock, thread B succeeds (could have been</span>
<span class="c1">// thread A)</span>

<p>All of this discussion is to say the following: a bounded buffer requires a
mutex in order to be considered <strong>thread safe</strong>. This means that multiple
threads can use the bounded buffer simultaneously without causing any problems
due to race conditions. Because of the scenarios bounded buffers are used in,
thread-safety is often a requirement.</p>

<h4 id="condition-variables">Condition Variables</h4>

<p>For bounded buffers, there is one additional construct required for correct
operation. This is called either a signal or a <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable">condition
variable</a>.
Condition variables allow threads to communicate to each other that some
condition has been met.</p>

<p>In a bounded buffer, this is necessary when one or more consumers are waiting
for data to be placed into an empty buffer. After executing a wait command, each
consumer thread is put into a queue corresponding to the shared condition
variable it is waiting on. When the condition variable is <strong>notified</strong>, the next
consumer thread is allowed to run. Producer threads manually notify the
condition variable after putting data into the buffer. The condition variable
then wakes up the next waiting consumer thread automatically.</p>

<p>Waiting on a condition variable is in contrast to a polling strategy. In a
polling strategy, the next waiting consumer thread in the queue would
continuously check the status of the buffer. Once it finds an available piece of
data in the buffer, it starts running. This is more wasteful of CPU cycles since
polling requires the thread to be actively doing something, while condition
variables allow the thread to be put to sleep.</p>

<p>Remembering back to the donut shop example, the waiting strategy is akin to
customers sitting down and waiting for donuts to become available if none are
ready. Once a donut is made, the customer waiting the longest is alerted. The
polling strategy, on the other hand, corresponds to the next customer repeatedly
checking whether donuts are ready.</p>

<p>The same pattern works in the other direction: producer threads are also put
into their own queue when the buffer is full, while consumer threads notify a
second condition variable when empty space becomes available in the buffer. To
be explicit, the bounded buffer contains two thread queues and two condition
variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One queue to store waiting consumer threads</li>
  <li>One condition variable to notify data is available in the buffer</li>
  <li>One queue to store waiting producer threads</li>
  <li>One condition variable to notify empty space is available in the buffer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve covered the motivation for implementing bounded buffers and some
of the high-level features associated with them, we are ready to get into the
weeds of an actual implementation. That will be covered in part 2. We will
discuss the API design, the C++ implementations of mutexes/condition variables,
and the source code of some of the bounded buffer functions.</p>
